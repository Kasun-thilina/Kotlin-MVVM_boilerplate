# Boilerplates

This is a very simple Boilerplate application, this has following features.

  - User can Sign In and Up
  - After signing in he can see a list of items
  
  #### I didn't add many functionality and didn't polish UI intentionally, tried to keep it barebone as much as possible 
  
  ### Same implementation in other platforms
   - [iOS](https://github.com/simpleboilerplates/BooksDemoiOS) 
   - [Flutter](https://github.com/SimpleBoilerplates/Flutter) 
   - [React Native](https://github.com/SimpleBoilerplates/React-Native) 
   - [NodeJS backend](https://github.com/simpleboilerplates/BooksDemoNode) 
 
# With

  - MVVM architecture
  - [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for API call
  - [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) like [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata), [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
  - [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx)
  - [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) for asynchronous programming and more and ditch AsyncTask!
  - Project by feature not by layer
